A migration is a version-controlled file that tells database
how to build or update structure. For example, you could write
a migration which says I want a table called 'journeys' with
a, b, c columns. Knex runs migrations and creates tables for you.
If you need to change database, you can write a new migration to
add, delete, or modify columns.

TL:DR Migrations are how you talk to database to create tables

Sample ex.

Create a migration file called users. This will contain the instructions
to create teh users table.

Then, when you npx knex migrate:latest, all new migration files will be
applied to datavase.
